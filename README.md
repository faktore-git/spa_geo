TOPOJSON/GEOJSON for NABU SPA

This repository acts as a placeholder for a composer package to fetch GEOJSON/TOPOPJSON-files to be used on deployment.

This repo is only public to make it easy for composer. Public users don't really have a use for this.

It is seperate from the main repository due to git size implications.
